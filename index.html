    <h1>Naliakas Fashion Blog</h1>
    <p>Fashion is part of the daily air and it changes all the time, with all the events. You can even see the approaching of a revolution in clothes. You can see and feel everything in clothes and I firmly believe that with the right footwear one can rule the world</p>

      <div class="one">
      <li>winter</li>
      <p>winter is a cold season and so some heavy clothes to prevent the cold is opted.The following can work for winter;</p>
      <div class="div1">
      <h4>Shearling Accents & Bright Colors</h4>
      <p class="p2">A coat with shearling accents. Often, you’ll see this as an oversized denim jacket with a shearling collar or cuffs,this offers a stylish way to add texture to a look while keeping warm.A coat, trench or long jacket in a bright and vibrant shade works magic too. Here,i'll showcase a pink option, an on-trend mustard shade and an elegant pale blue coat. Each gives a look it’s own added glam. Don’t feel obligated to wear these with just neutral looks! These jackets look beautiful styled with complementary shades or as a standout piece.</p>

      <div class="div2">
      <h4>Tonal outfits</h4>
      <p class="p3">Head-to-toe monochromatic looks are another go-to trend.A warm brown, camel-colored outfit, but shades of grey or a mix of white and cream are equally chic. The key to wearing this trend is to play with a few tones that complement each other without perfectly matching. Here, we’ve paired a camel-colored turtleneck with a slightly darker brown pant, red-brown boots and either a tan jacket or, if you’re craving added pattern, a long, checked coat that nods to the tones of the other pieces. Give this one a try for drinks with a girlfriend or a work event.</p>

          <h4>Baby Blue Embroidery Bardot Dress</h4>
          <p class="p6">Baby blue is a gorgeous colour for summer,which is exactly why we can’t stop swooning over this beautiful bardot neck dress! This mini dress has an off the shoulder top finishing with a frill layer. It then falls into an a line mini dress. We adore the yellow and orange flowers embroidered along the frill.

            <h4>Stripy Camisole, Shorts and Heels</h4>
            <p class="p7">Shorts and heels are an unbeatable combination for summer. This look elongates the legs no end, showing off your perfect pins. This style is especially wonderful thanks to the super chic stripy camisole which is incredibly flattering and works perfectly with the beige shorts. Finish with a lightweight longline jacket and some chunky statement heels for a look to die for this summer.</p>
